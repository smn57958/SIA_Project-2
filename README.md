# Advance Information Systems Project No : 2

A user will be able to type a search term (a single keyword or phrase such as a personâ€™s first and last names), a street address including a city and an optional zip code, and radius in km. Your application will need find "keyword" videos in a geographic area centered in longitude, and latitude with given radius.
